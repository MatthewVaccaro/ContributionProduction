className=\"paragraph\">\n            Throughout the last two years, the company you work for has made a\n            name for its self by being one of the first online-only banking\n            applications. As time has caught up with the company more and more\n            banks have followed in suit. The last six months have been very\n            focused on refining the product but there has been no improvement in\n            acquisition or retention. Based on decisions made by VPs and board\n            members the company wants to make a large push to differentiate\n            themselves and focus more on a particular market/people group to\n            improve our offering. The news of this initiative is explained to\n            you by your PM in this morning's meeting...\n          </p>\n\n          <p className={toggleState ? \"hint\" : \"hidden\"}>\n            The company believes their lack of focus on a people group is what\n            is making their numbers stagnate. Your set of features work for the\n            generic public, but so does everyone else. The solution is not to\n            build more features, but to find an under served people group and\n            provide them value.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Actionable Steps: 1. Understand you're current value prop. 2.\n            Analyze the target market. 3. Identify different audiences & create\n            different segments? 4. Repeat until you have a group of potential\n            audiences.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Helpful UX articles:{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://www.bitcatcha.com/blog/how-to-define-your-users-find-them-solve-their-problems/\">\n              How To Define Your Users\n            </a>{\" \"}\n            |{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/target-audience-research-users-research-part-1-8470753deb9e\">\n              Target Audience Research\n            </a>\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"paragraph bar\">\n            I am sure by now you have heard something about the new initiative;\n            it's very exciting and the board is pushing for it to start right\n            away. The last few days, Jerry and I have had a few meetings with\n            leadership and they have granted us a lot of leeway on how to go\n            about this initiative.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            The majority of this project is around finding a new audience we can\n            serve more directly. This doesn't mean we're removing any features,\n            we will continue to still be a bank and serve the general public. On\n            top of this, the board wants us to come up with a single or set of\n            features as our first push for this new found audience.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            There is no timeline for this project just yet, but we want to treat\n            this with a level of urgency. We also want all of you to pair up and\n            tackle this project two by two. This doesn't mean splitting up the\n            work, but going through each step together and having a constant\n            feedback loop.
