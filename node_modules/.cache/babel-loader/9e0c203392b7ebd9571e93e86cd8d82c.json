Since then the company has launch two more child products\n            and now works with two internal incubators that go simultaneously,\n            cycling teams in and out every six months. Today the CEO announced\n            at the all-hands, the project focus and handed picked you along with\n            7 others to be a part of the team for the newest incubator!\n          </p>\n\n          <p className={toggleState ? \"hint\" : \"hidden\"}>\n            Remember you're a solo designer in a fast-paced environment, you\n            need to focus heavily on solving the main pain point to keep your\n            MVP small enough to be built in time.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Helpful UX articles:{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://www.bitcatcha.com/blog/how-to-define-your-users-find-them-solve-their-problems/\">\n              MVP in UX\n            </a>\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"paragraph bar\">\n            Thank you all for being here, I am always excited to announce the\n            start of a new incubator project!

Let's go over the project details, shall we? The focus\n            of this new product will be improving productivity internally for\n            companies or externally for individuals. With this, we need to\n            figure out a few key pieces. One, what is our main pain point we\n            want to solve for MVP. Two, who are we solving for and why. Three,\n            why is this the most important pain point to solve. We will also\n            want to do some thinking around where the product will go, how it\n            might scale, and ideas around monetization. Once we have achieved\n            these things we can present this to the leadership team to have\n            finally buy-in and launch this product!\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            We always want to start these projects off on the right foot, so\n            Arron & Rochelle hooked us up with some data to start with.
