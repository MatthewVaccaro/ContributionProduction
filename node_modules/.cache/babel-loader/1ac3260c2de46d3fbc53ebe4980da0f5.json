For the last decade, they\n              have made a name for themselves by talking about human connection,\n              the lack of it in our world, mental health, and how we can better.\n              Mentive is looking to step into the tech industry by launching a\n              native mobile app. At this point, the company is unsure of the\n              direction to take this application but know they want it to be\n              centered around human connection. The VP over publishing & design\n              emailed you her thoughts...\n            </p>\n\n            <div className={toggleState ? \"hint\" : \"hidden\"}>\n              You're helping to introduce a non-tech company into the tech\n              world. Their sole purpose is to improve people's lives through\n              human connection - this piece is vital and is the keystone of your\n              problems & solutions. Human connection has levels & Mentive is\n              focusing on quality rather than quantity. A question to ask\n              yourself is \"How might I help people to have more high-quality\n              connections in their life?\" Lastly, these connections do not have\n              to be in person!\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Actionable Steps: 1. Start doing research 2. Be curious! 3. Start\n              making hypotheses & how you might test them.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Helpful UX articles:{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://usabilitygeek.com/how-to-conduct-ux-research/\">\n                {\" \"}\n                UX Research\n              </a>\n            </div>\n\n            <p className=\"paragraph bar\">\n              The world we live in is more emotionally and socially disconnected\n              then it has ever been. Mentive was born out of the desire to help\n              and be a voice to reconnect with each other! We have had great\n              success over the last years 3 years and have built a very\n              passionate community. As proud of our work as we are, there is\n              much more we can do! We can write the best articles about mental\n              health & how to connect more deeply but it has to resonate with\n              thousands of people. We're ready to be more personal with our\n              users and impact them as individuals. We don't know what this\n              looks like but we want to help people connect deeper (platonic or\n              otherwise). We also don't want to associate the magazine at all\n              with this product. In preparation for kicking off this project I\n              had Richard, my project manager gathers together some data we have\n              collected about our readers over the last 6 months. By no means do\n              you have to use this research. If you feel it's necessary, conduct\n              more research. We're all excited to see where this product goes\n              and the impact we can make!\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Cheers,\n              <br />\n              Juliann Van Brooks\n            </p>\n\n            <div className={toggleState ? \"hint\" : \"hidden\"}>\n              Another goal for this product is to be personal, to help\n              individuals in ways their magazine can not. This can be in the\n              form of building stronger current relationships, cultivating new\n              ones, helping people get out of their shell, helping with mental\n              health and SO MUCH MORE!
