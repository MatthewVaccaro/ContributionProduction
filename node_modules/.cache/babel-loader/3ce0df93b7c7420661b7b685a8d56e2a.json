With this,\n              we need to figure out a few key pieces. One, what is our main pain\n              point we want to solve for MVP. Two, who are we solving for and\n              why. Three, why is this the most important pain point to solve. We\n              will also want to do some thinking around where the product will\n              go, how it might scale, and ideas around monetization. Once we\n              have achieved these things we can present this to the leadership\n              team to have finally buy-in and launch this product!\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              We always want to start these projects off on the right foot, so\n              Arron & Rochelle hooked us up with some data to start with.
