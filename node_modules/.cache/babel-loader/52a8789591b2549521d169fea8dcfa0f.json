Human connection has levels & Mentive is\n            focusing on quality rather than quantity. A question to ask yourself\n            is \"How might I help people to have more high-quality connections in\n            their life?\" Lastly, these connections do not have to be in person!\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Actionable Steps: 1.

We have had great\n            success over the last years 3 years and have built a very passionate\n            community. As proud of our work as we are, there is much more we can\n            do! We can write the best articles about mental health & how to\n            connect more deeply but it has to resonate with thousands of people.\n            We're ready to be more personal with our users and impact them as\n            individuals. We don't know what this looks like but we want to help\n            people connect deeper (platonic or otherwise). We also don't want to\n            associate the magazine at all with this product. In preparation for\n            kicking off this project I had Richard, my project manager gathers\n            together some data we have collected about our readers over the last\n            6 months.
