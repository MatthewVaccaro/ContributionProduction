            <p className="paragraph">
              You're apart of a small start-up of 11 employees that's flagship
              app is a music streaming service. The app touts 37 million songs,
              9 Million artists, and thirty thousand daily users. The CEO
              recently announced through email that the company had just
              received a new round of funding of just under $3 million to
              completely pivot the the product. The email reads...

            <div className={toggleState ? "hint" : "hidden"}>
              The company you work for has received a large amount of money to
              change the goals/north-star of the business AKA pivot. This pivot
              will change the complete direction of the company. This means your
              thinking needs to be beyond just music streaming! Imagine you're
              on a boat in the middle of the ocean, you can go any direction you
              want! You just need a strong reason why.

              Three weeks ago I had the opportunity to pitch our product to the
              amazing people over at Inducate. They really loved all the hard
              work we have put into the product and the culture we have built
              over the last 16 months. They however do have some doubts about
              our product and believe that a large streaming library is just not
              enough to fight against the giants around us like Spotify,
              Pandora, and Apple Music. What they do believe in is the people we
              have here, the work we have done, and the work we are capable of.
              They're investing $2.75 million into the company for us to pivot
              and find a niche space in the music industry to make our own! More
              details will follow in the coming weeks, thank you all for your
              hard-work thus far!

              Don't worry about fighting other companies and their features.
              Focus on the market/people group you will identify and solve THEIR
              problems. Spotify or Apple Music might have a similar feature but
              if the problem is still being found then it's not solved or their
              is potential room in the market for you!

              I am sure by now the good news of the funding has reached you!
              With it, comes a lot of work and a lot of questions to be
              answered. namely, what direction to take this product! Now I want
              you to have the tools you need to succeed. After Inducate
              expressed their doubts I contacted Rachel and had her set up user
              interviews and start conducting research. I haven't had much of an
              opportunity to look at the data, but from what I saw it has some
              potential in guiding your next steps. This doesn't mean you can't
              do research on your own, in fact, I encourage it! I just want to
              help where I can. We're looking to move pretty quick, so I would
              like you to get started right away and present a case for the
              direction you propose. I am excited to see what you come up with!

              Above is six sets of data that you can take in different
              directions. You need to research each path and see where they
              lead. This doesn't mean just Google-ing, you need to go beyond
              that. You need to find users and talk to them (appropriately). You
              can utilize social media and do a survey, ask family members or if
              you're brave enough go talk to strangers!
              <br />
              <br />
              Actionable steps: 1. Start with a hypotheses, things you want to
              validate. 2. Create questions around your hypotheses, make sure
              every-question has a reason & and potential follow up. 3. Before
              testing PRACTICE! In the mirror or with a friend, it will help.

              the discovery and doing research. This can take form in looking
              competitors, reading blogs, talking to people on social media, and
              much more. Be curious and find opportunities to solve pain points.
              Make sure you don't stop after going down one path, go down as
              many as you can! There are many directions you can take this ship
              and you need to at least look at them all. Take your time, this is
